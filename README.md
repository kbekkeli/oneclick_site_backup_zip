oneclick_site_backup_zip
========================

A php script that backup/zip your whole site with a single click in case you are having difficulties.
I once had a problem with one of my clients that can't move his site to new hosting, the old site didn't have any kind of control panels installed, he only got ftp access, so I had to improvise and make this script.

This script uses the SZIP php class to zip the entire site, and I have an other version of it using the system function to zip and unzip which is more reliable but not always available.


Todo

*Add a second method that zips and unzips using System function
